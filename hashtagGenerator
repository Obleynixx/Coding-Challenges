/*The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!
Here's the deal:

    It must start with a hashtag (#).
    All words must have their first letter capitalized.
    If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
    If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.
*/
function generateHashtag (str) {
  //check if str is empty
  if (str.trim().length === 0) return false;
  //split into an array with each word
  words = str.split(" ");
  //loop through the words an capitalize the first letter
  for (i = 0;i<words.length;i++){
    words[i] = words[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + words[i].slice(1);
  }
  //add # to the result
  let result = "#"+words.join("");
  //check if final result is longer than 140
  if (result.length > 140) return false;
  //send result
  return result;
